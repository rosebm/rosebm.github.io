I'm a Software Engineer specialized on Android Development from Caracas, Venezuela.

I’ve always been fascinated by how mobile technology can simplify everyday life. The idea that a few lines of code can solve real-world problems, bring joy, or improve someone’s daily routine is what drives me. Turning that passion into a career—where I get to build meaningful, impactful products—is both exciting and fulfilling.

If I'm not coding mobile apps, I'm probably filling my curiosity on another areas such as AR and Games. When I'm not in front of my laptop, I'm usually working out, playing tennis or learning French.


I'm always experimenting, always learning.
