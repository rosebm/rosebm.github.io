I'm a Software Engineer specialized on Android Development from Caracas, Venezuela.

Who does not think that mobiles are making easier our daily life? Just by thinking that through some code and deploy you are able to solve practical problems is impressive, that by delivering a product you can improve people’s life, or entertain them… is unbelievable, especially when that passion is your career.

If I'm not coding for mobile apps, probably I'm filling my curiosity on another areas such as AR and Games. When I'm not in front of my laptop, I'm usually working out, playing tennis or learning French.


I'm always experimenting, always learning.
