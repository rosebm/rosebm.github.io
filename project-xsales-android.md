Company: [XSales Mobility](https://xsalesmobility.com/)

B2B Application designed to provide SaaS services, the app supported 3 modes:
- Pre-sales: generating an order and a receipt
- Delivery: once the client is visited, and the order delivered, the stock is reduced after a data synchronization
- Autosales: once visiting a client, the order was made and automatically synced with the server in order to update the stock available and generate the receipt.

The app was developed on Android Studio using Java and SQLite, only available through a private store called [XSales Store](https://xsalesstore.com/). Is currently present in the US, Latin America and the Caribbean.
