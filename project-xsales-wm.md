Company: [XSales Mobility](https://xsalesmobility.com/)

B2B Application designed to provide SaaS services, the app supported 3 modes:
- Pre-sales: generating an order and a receipt
- Delivery: once the client is visited, and the order delivered, the stock is reduced after a data synchronization
- Autosales: once visiting a client, the order was made and automatically synced with the server in order to update the stock available and generate the receipt.

This version for Windows Mobile (versions 5 and 6) was developed on Visual Studio.Net using C# and SQLite; 2 executable files were needed due to size limitations: Windows Mobile allowed up to 25Mb per executable.

The app is currently present in the US, Latin America and Caribbean.
