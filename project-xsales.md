B2B Application designed to provide SaaS services, the app supported 3 modes:
- Pre-sales: generating an order and a receipt
- Delivery: once the client is visited, and the order delivered, the stock is reduced after a data synchronization
- Autosales: once visiting a client, the order was made and automatically synced with the server in order to update the stock available and generate the receipt.



The app running under Windows Mobile (versions 5 and 6) was developed using C# and SQLite, the challenge here: the limit size for apps on Windows Mobile up to 25Mb, so the app had to be divided into 2 executables.

The app is currently present in the US, Latin America and Caribbean.
